  = Defining the Core Problem for Chess Players’ Social Experience
])

= 1. Introduction
This document represents Stage 2: Define of the design thinking process as outlined by the Interaction Design Foundation. Building directly on the insights gathered during Stage 1: Empathize, this stage focuses on synthesizing research findings into a clear, human-centered problem definition. \ \

The Define stage translates empathy into clarity. Rather than proposing solutions, it identifies what problem truly needs to be solved from the users’ perspective. \ \

The findings in this document are grounded primarily in an in-depth interview with the client, Troyan, a former high-school professional chess player, supported by secondary research and observations of broader chess communities.

= 2. Summary of Empathy Findings (Input to Define Stage)
From Stage 1, several consistent themes emerged across Troyan’s experiences and supporting research:

- Chess players experience social isolation, even when playing frequently
- Existing chess platforms prioritize competition, ratings, and performance
- Emotional aspects of chess (loss, growth, frustration, pride) are under-supported
- General social media platforms are poorly suited to meaningful chess discussion
- Players desire recognition beyond winning, including effort, creativity, and learning
- Many players feel unsafe asking questions or sharing mistakes

These findings form the foundation for defining the core user problem.

= 3. Core User Needs (Synthesized)
In the Define stage, raw observations are clustered into clear user needs.

= 3.1 Functional Needs
Chess players need to:

- Communicate and share chess-related experiences in context
- Discuss games, ideas, and learning moments without excessive friction
- Connect with players of similar interests, levels, or goals

= 3.2 Emotional Needs
Chess players need to:

- Feel a sense of belonging within the chess community
- Receive validation that is not solely tied to winning
- Feel psychologically safe when sharing mistakes or asking questions

= 3.3 Social Needs
Chess players need to:

- Build ongoing relationships, not just one-off interactions
- Learn socially through discussion, mentorship, and peer feedback
- Express identity as chess players beyond ratings and results

= 4. User Point of View (POV) Statement
To humanize the problem, the Define stage produces a Point of View (POV) statement, combining user, need, and insight. \ \

_A committed chess player needs a way to connect meaningfully with other players because current chess environments focus on performance over people, leaving players socially disconnected despite frequent play._ \ \

This POV reflects Troyan’s lived experience and represents a broader segment of chess players.

= 5. Problem Statement (Design Challenge)
Based on synthesized insights, the core problem can be articulated as a How Might We (HMW) question: \ \

_How might we support meaningful social connection among chess players without centering interaction solely around competition and ratings?_ \ \

This problem statement is intentionally open-ended, allowing multiple potential solutions in later stages.

= 6. Key Pain Points (Clearly Defined)
From Troyan’s perspective and broader research, the following pain points are most critical:

- Transactional interactions – Most chess interactions end when a game ends
- Identity reduction – Players are reduced to ratings, not personalities
- Emotional neglect – Loss, frustration, and improvement journeys are ignored
- Fragmentation – Chess discussion is spread across platforms not built for it
- Psychological risk – Fear of judgment discourages participation

These pain points define what is broken, not how to fix it.

= 7. Success Criteria (User-Centered, Not Feature-Based)
To know whether the problem has been addressed in future stages, success should be measured by:

- Players feeling more connected to other chess players
- Increased willingness to share games, questions, and experiences
- Reduced fear of judgment or elitism
- Stronger sense of community identity

These criteria remain user-outcome focused, not solution-focused.

= 8. Constraints and Considerations
The Define stage also acknowledges constraints derived from user research:

- Chess culture values seriousness and skill—solutions must respect this
- Competitive players still value performance and improvement
- Over-socialization risks diluting the chess focus

These considerations will guide ideation without narrowing creativity prematurely

= 9. Refined Problem Definition
Bringing all elements together, the refined problem definition is: \ \

_Chess players, particularly those invested in long-term improvement, lack a socially meaningful environment that supports emotional expression, learning, and identity—resulting in isolation within a fundamentally social game._

= 10. Conclusion
This Define-stage document translates empathy into focus. By grounding the problem in Troyan’s lived experience and broader chess community patterns, it establishes a clear, human-centered challenge without prescribing solutions. \ \

This clarity will enable the next stage—Ideate—to explore solutions that genuinely address user needs rather than surface-level symptoms.
