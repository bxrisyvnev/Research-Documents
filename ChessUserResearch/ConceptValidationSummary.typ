  = Concept Validation Summary
])

A concept validation meeting was conducted with Troyan, the project client and a former high-school professional chess player, to evaluate whether the ChessPlatform concept accurately reflects user needs and lived experiences identified during earlier research stages.
\ \
During the discussion, Troyan confirmed that the core problem addressed by the concept—the lack of meaningful social connection within existing chess platforms—strongly aligns with his personal experience. He emphasized that while chess platforms facilitate frequent interaction through gameplay, these interactions often feel transactional and lack lasting social value.
\ \
Troyan positively validated the platform’s focus on identity beyond rating, noting that traditional chess environments tend to reduce players to performance metrics while overlooking creativity, learning, and contribution. He expressed that features centered on authored content, discussion, and profiles provide a more human and authentic representation of chess players.
\ \
The inclusion of moderation and reporting mechanisms was also affirmed as necessary, particularly for fostering psychological safety and reducing toxic behavior. Troyan highlighted that visible moderation encourages participation, especially among less confident or learning-oriented players.
\ \
Additionally, Troyan supported the integration of live streaming and real-time chat, identifying these as effective ways to recreate the communal atmosphere of physical chess clubs in an online setting.
\ \
Overall, Troyan stated that the concept successfully translates research insights into a coherent and realistic platform vision. He confirmed that the concept complements existing chess platforms rather than attempting to replace them and expressed that he would personally find value in using such a platform.
\ \
This validation confirms that the ChessPlatform concept remains aligned with user needs, grounded in real experience, and consistent with the goals of human-centered design.
